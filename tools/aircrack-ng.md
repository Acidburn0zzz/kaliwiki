Notes

 * Version: 1.2-beta2 release  
 * Kali Linux Verison: 1.0.5  
 * Developers: Jaime Penalba & Alvaro


**Purpose**: Aircrack-ng is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can recover keys once enough data packets have been captured. It implements the standard FMS attack along with some optimizations like KoreK attacks, as well as the all-new PTW attack, thus making the attack much faster compared to other WEP cracking tools.
